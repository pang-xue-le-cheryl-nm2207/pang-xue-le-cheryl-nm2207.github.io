Those aged 25-29 years come in second place with a 31.8% increase. Ok ok, too many words and numbers? Let's continue looking at some more beautifully crafted charts! Let's zoom in on the youngters, aka those aged 20-34 years. Perhaps it is more relatable for you! I've also split the data according to gender. Click on buttons to find out more.</p>

                As seen in the radar chart below, more people are meeting their partners via online channels these days, while the influence of friends in making people couples is dwindling.
                There seems to be a gap between how singles hope to meet their potential partners and how people are actually meeting their potential partners. For the people who are single,
                could their preference of meeting peoeple through traditional means over online means be limiting their opportunities?
